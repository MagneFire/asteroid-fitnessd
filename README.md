# Asteroid fitness daemon
This project consists of a simple daemon that tracks the pedometer (and maybe more) sensor. A different AsteroidOS app can use the data generated by this daemon for insight in steps taken on a daily basis.

WIP, nothing has been done apart from thinking ;)
General structure will be:
- Use sensorfw backend to open a pedometer sensor.
- Keep track of steps during the day.
- When the date changes, the steps are automatically reset.
- For now, use config values to keep track of steps.
  - Has the added benefit of allowing AsteroidOS apps to use these too.
